# 1. Binary Trees 

Complete the two `find()` methods and the `add()` method in the `StudentTree` class. The a student tree object is a binary tree that stores students. 

The `add()` method should be randomized. For example, starting from an empty tree and adding two students (student 1 first, then student 2), the resulting tree should look like

```
student 1
     \
    student 2
```

50% of the time, and look like 

```
    student 1
     /
student 2 
```

50% of the time.
